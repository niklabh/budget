(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

Trafficking

in

persons

is

a

major

9

transnational crime, as recognized by the Trafficking

10

Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et

seq.; division A of Public Law 106–386).

12

(2) Trafficking in persons is increasingly per-

13

petrated by organized, sophisticated criminal enter-

14

prises.

15

(3) Combating trafficking in persons requires a

16

global approach to identifying and apprehending the

17

world’s worst human trafficking rings.

18

(b) SENSE

OF

CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-

19 gress that the Department of State’s rewards program is
20 a powerful tool in combating sophisticated international
21 crime and that the Department of State and Federal law
22 enforcement should work in concert to offer rewards that
23 target human traffickers who prey on the most vulnerable

SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.

2

Congress makes the following findings:

3

(1) The Palestinian Authority’s practice of pay-

4

ing salaries to terrorists serving in Israeli prisons, as

5

well as to the families of deceased terrorists, is an

6

incentive to commit acts of terror.

7

(2) The United States does not provide direct

8

budgetary support to the Palestinian Authority. The

9

United States does pay certain debts held by the

10

Palestinian Authority and funds programs for which

11

the Palestinian Authority would otherwise be respon-

12

sible.

13

(3) The United States Government supports

14

community-based programs in the West Bank and

15

Gaza that provide for basic human needs, such as

16

food, water, health, shelter, protection, education,

3

This division may be cited as the ‘‘Clarifying Lawful

4 Overseas Use of Data Act’’ or the ‘‘CLOUD Act’’.
5

SEC. 102. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

6

Congress finds the following:

7

(1) Timely access to electronic data held by

8

communications-service providers is an essential

9

component of government efforts to protect public

10

safety and combat serious crime, including ter-

11

rorism.

12

(2) Such efforts by the United States Govern-

13

ment are being impeded by the inability to access

14

data stored outside the United States that is in the

15

custody, control, or possession of communications-

16

service providers that are subject to jurisdiction of

17

the United States.

18

(3) Foreign governments also increasingly seek

19

access to electronic data held by communications-

20

service providers in the United States for the pur-

21

pose of combating serious crime.

22

(4) Communications-service providers face po-

23

tential conflicting legal obligations when a foreign

24

government orders production of electronic data that

March 21, 2018 (6:08 p.m.)

U:\2018REPT\OMNI\Final\RCP—FM.xml

2202
1

United States law may prohibit providers from dis-

2

closing.

3

(5) Foreign law may create similarly conflicting

4

legal obligations when chapter 121 of title 18,

5

United States Code (commonly known as the ‘‘

6

Stored Communications Act’’), requires disclosure of

7

electronic data that foreign law prohibits commu-

8

nications-service providers from disclosing.

9

(6) International agreements provide a mecha-

10

nism for resolving these potential conflicting legal

11

obligations where the United States and the relevant

12

foreign government share a common commitment to

13

the rule of law and the protection of privacy and

14

civil liberties.
