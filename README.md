# 2018 budget of 1.3 trillion

US budget of 2018 is huge. So i have created a visualisation which will help estimate relative spending.
Budget is in this [pdf file](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180319/BILLS-115SAHR1625-RCP115-66.pdf).
Converted to txt doc. Data is parsed to extract $384,345,344 type numbers. Numbers are plotted with a d3 bubble chart.
